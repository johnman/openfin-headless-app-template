# openfin-headless-app-template

This is a basic template that can be used in codesandbox.

The goal of this template is to show how to build something agent like. This application can either be a platform or window based application. It does not have a UI and some config files set it up so that it autostarts on login.

Some things you will need to update:

In config/\*.fin.json

- uuid : make the uuid unique
- visit https://www.openfin.co and request a trial/developer license
- update the url field to reflect your codesandbox url
- update the application icon to reflect your own icon
- update the name and description to reflect your application
